# Use GeoCal Skeleton

This provides a sample skeleton for setting up a project to extend
[GeoCal](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/Cartography/geocal). If you simple
want to use GeoCal as a python library nothing needs to be done. But if you
want to add new C++, wrap this is SWIG, and make available to GeoCal programs
then there is some cookie cutter code to write.

This also make use of [general-autoconf](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/Cartography/general-autoconf), see [README Git](README.git) for details.
