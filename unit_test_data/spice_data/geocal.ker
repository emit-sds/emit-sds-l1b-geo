This is a list of kernels to load in for use by geocal. Right now, we
always load the same kernels. We could do something more complicated if
needed in the future.

If you update the version of other kernels, you need to also update this
file to point to the updated versions.

We specify the top directory for the spice data as $A, which we can then
move if needed.
