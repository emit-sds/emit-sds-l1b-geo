This directory contains the various SPICE kernels that we install as part
of AFIDS.

You can get new/updated kernels at the NAIF SPICE site 
http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data.html.

The only kernel that changes often in the earth_000101_xxxx.bpc files (updated
at least twice a week). You can check the other ones also of course, but 
they don't vary quickly.

Here is the information on the earth_000101 files:

   High accuracy EOP-based kernel, updated at least twice per week:

      earth_000101_yymmdd_yymmdd.bpc
      earth_latest_high_prec.bpc

   The first two dates in the first file name are the file's coverage start
   and stop times. The third date in that file name is the epoch of the
   last datum in the source EOP file: earth orientation from this date
   forward is predicted.

   The second file is a copy of the first. The name of this file remains
   unchanged. 

We use the symbolic link earth_latest_high_prec.bpc, you can update this
link to the latest kernel if you download a new one.

***IMPORTANT***
If you update the kernels, you should also update the file "geocal.ker".
This lists the kernels that we actually load as part of geocal. If you update
a file but don't update geocal.ker then we don't actually use the new
updated file.

You don't need to update geocal.ker if you just update the symbolic link
earth_latest_high_prec.bpc.
