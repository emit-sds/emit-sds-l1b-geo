We produce a SPICE kernel for the ISS orbit.

To do this, we first started by downloading the Two Line Element (TLE) 
covering 2020 from space-track.org. Note that this contains duplicates,
not sure why.

The data is generated by using the "query builder", where we request
the tle ordered by epoch for object number 25544 (the ISS number)
with the epoch > 2020-01-01 00:00:00 and epoch < 2021-01-01 00:00:00.
For reference this gives a API link:

https://www.space-track.org/basicspacedata/query/class/tle/OBJECT_NUMBER/25544/EPOCH/>2020-01-01 00:00:00,<2021-01-01 00:00:00/orderby/EPOCH asc/emptyresult/show

The data was then downloaded as iss_tle.json

The data is a json file, that we need to process into a straight text file
for SPICE:

python iss_tl_process.py

This data has been downloaded to the file iss_tle.txt.

We then hand created the file iss_spice.txt. Note that this file has
hardcoded paths, so if you need to rerun the spice generation you may need
to edit these file. The paths are for the CartLab computer pistol.

We then create the spice kernel by 

mkspk -setup iss_spice.txt

Where mkspk is a spice program for making a spice kernel.
