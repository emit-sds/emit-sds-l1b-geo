This contains data from the original pyortho code (at
git@github.jpl.nasa.gov:bbue/pyortho.git). This was found in the "camera_model"
directory.

The data is a simple binary format, see ingest_camera_to_flas.py for
reading this data.

We have taken this data, imported it into AFIDS/Geocal, and saved it out as an
xml file that Geocal can read.
