For doing fully py.test, just use the standard makefile targets
(e.g., python_check). However, if you want to run single tests because you are
developing/debugging, then you need to make sure the current directory is
in the python path so we get the test_support directory. You can do this with
the test.sh here.

./test.sh lib/tie_point_collect_test.py
