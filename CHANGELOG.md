#### v1.0.0

> 9 February 2022

- Add Resampler. This is almost a duplicate of the ECOSTRESS version, we should perhaps move this into GeoCal at some point. But for now put here so we don't force a geocal update. [`bbe4ce3`](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/emit-sds/emit-sds-l1b-geo/commit/bbe4ce3d7acf9798392a589176c96e8fce0ca9f7)
